    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "- Hostelworld is a website that connects independent, budget, and youthful travelers to hostels. For the past 10 years Hostelworld has lead the market in online reservations for this demographic. The website lets users search for hostels given a location, group size, and dates. It also lets the user filter for prefered features and prices. \n",
    "- The goal of this project is to make hostel recommendation for a users based on other users that are similar to them, and hostels that are similar to those they have reviewed highly.\n",
    "- However most hostels have very similar features, and given that hostels are budget accommodation they usually fall in the same price range. For this reason the text of hostel descriptions and reviews needs to be taken into account when making hostel recommendations."
