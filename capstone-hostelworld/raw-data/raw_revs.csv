2,"Overall the hostel was great and nice, if a little spartan, but the bathroom could have been nicer and cleaner (you had to hold the shower head yourself and small doesn't even begin to describe the size of the shower) and the only other problem was that there were some REALLY noisy guys in the room down the hall, and the walls were really thin, so they kept waking us up, but that wasn't the hostel's fault.
