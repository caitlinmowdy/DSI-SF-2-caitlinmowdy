                    Hullam Hostel was built nearly 100 years ago and it stands in the heart of the town of Revfulop. Revfulop is situated on the north shore of the lake on the boundary of the Balaton-Highland National Park and the Kali Basin. You can see the whole lake from the nearby tower. The town is famous for its excellent wine, its sports events (e.g. swimming across Lake Balaton) beaches and ancient trees. , 
, 
This hostel is a great base in and out from Budapest or the Adriatic Sea. If you are curious to discover this unique region of Hungary and to meet locals or to taste the local specialities (in music, food, customs) then this hostel is probably the best choice for you. , 
We usually have live music bands ( folk, jazz ) on the evenings and cooking together on open  fire is quite common, too. There are several local  festivals around and we provide up-to-date info about these. , 
If you need some privacy the other day then you can  read or have a nap in a hammock back in the garden. , 
, 
You can rent a bike at your disposal on the spot. The nearby Kali basin is a true paradise for bike lovers with its beautiful surroundings and rare fauna. The lake is ideal for sailing and swimming, too. There are 2 local beaches to choose from, both are a few minutes walk from the hostel. You can also go horse riding in the neighbouring village of Kovagoors., 
All at exceedingly modest prices!, 
A place for all ages and interests highly recommended. The hostel is 2 and a half hour away from Budapest by train. It is easily accesable also from Balaton Airport ( 40 km away).

                    Hullam Hostel was built nearly 100 years ago and it stands in the heart of the town of Revfulop. Revfulop is situated on the north shore of the lake on the boundary of the Balaton-Highland National Park and the Kali Basin. You can see the whole lake from the nearby tower. The town is famous for its excellent wine, its sports events (e.g. swimming across Lake Balaton) beaches and ancient trees. , 
, 
This hostel is a great base in and out from Budapest or the Adriatic Sea. If you are curious to discover this unique region of Hungary and to meet locals or to taste the local specialities (in music, food, customs) then this hostel is probably the best choice for you. , 
We usually have live music bands ( folk, jazz ) on the evenings and cooking together on open  fire is quite common, too. There are several local  festivals around and we provide up-to-date info about these. , 
If you need some privacy the other day then you can  read or have a nap in a hammock back in the garden. , 
, 
You can rent a bike at your disposal on the spot. The nearby Kali basin is a true paradise for bike lovers with its beautiful surroundings and rare fauna. The lake is ideal for sailing and swimming, too. There are 2 local beaches to choose from, both are a few minutes walk from the hostel. You can also go horse riding in the neighbouring village of Kovagoors., 
All at exceedingly modest prices!, 
A place for all ages and interests highly recommended. The hostel is 2 and a half hour away from Budapest by train. It is easily accesable also from Balaton Airport ( 40 km away).

+++++++++warning about the taxi drivers+++++++++++, 
There is a high level of corruption between the taxis inside the bus station and some hostales! So please do not believe the taxi drivers when they try to persuade you not to come to arequipay backpackers properties taking you to other property, they always lie because those hostales pay the taxis commission and for sure you will not find a better property like arequipay, our comments are our best guarantee!,

Here are a few of our ideas to enhance your San Diego experience:, 
â¢	Spend a day at the beach â we can tell you where to catch the best wave, or sunset., 
â¢	Get international and take the trolley to Mexico â itâs only a short trolley ride away!, 
â¢	Go on a brewery tour and taste why San Diego is Beer City USA.,

There is tons of space to lounge around in and to make friends from all over the world before you hit the town.  If youâre looking to relax after a long day of sightseeing (or after a great night out in the Gaslamp Quarter), you can chill out in our TV room, enjoy our game room which is fully equipped with a pool table and video games or share a meal in our fully equipped kitchen.  , 
, 
Our hostel offers shared co-ed and single sex dorm accommodations of varying sizes to fit your budget.  If youâre looking for a little more privacy or comfort, we also offer private rooms complete with your own bathroom and air conditioner.

                    Hullam Hostel was built nearly 100 years ago and it stands in the heart of the town of Revfulop. Revfulop is situated on the north shore of the lake on the boundary of the Balaton-Highland National Park and the Kali Basin. You can see the whole lake from the nearby tower. The town is famous for its excellent wine, its sports events (e.g. swimming across Lake Balaton) beaches and ancient trees. , 
, 
This hostel is a great base in and out from Budapest or the Adriatic Sea. If you are curious to discover this unique region of Hungary and to meet locals or to taste the local specialities (in music, food, customs) then this hostel is probably the best choice for you. , 
We usually have live music bands ( folk, jazz ) on the evenings and cooking together on open  fire is quite common, too. There are several local  festivals around and we provide up-to-date info about these. , 
If you need some privacy the other day then you can  read or have a nap in a hammock back in the garden. , 
, 
You can rent a bike at your disposal on the spot. The nearby Kali basin is a true paradise for bike lovers with its beautiful surroundings and rare fauna. The lake is ideal for sailing and swimming, too. There are 2 local beaches to choose from, both are a few minutes walk from the hostel. You can also go horse riding in the neighbouring village of Kovagoors., 
All at exceedingly modest prices!, 
A place for all ages and interests highly recommended. The hostel is 2 and a half hour away from Budapest by train. It is easily accesable also from Balaton Airport ( 40 km away).

                    Hullam Hostel was built nearly 100 years ago and it stands in the heart of the town of Revfulop. Revfulop is situated on the north shore of the lake on the boundary of the Balaton-Highland National Park and the Kali Basin. You can see the whole lake from the nearby tower. The town is famous for its excellent wine, its sports events (e.g. swimming across Lake Balaton) beaches and ancient trees. , 
, 
This hostel is a great base in and out from Budapest or the Adriatic Sea. If you are curious to discover this unique region of Hungary and to meet locals or to taste the local specialities (in music, food, customs) then this hostel is probably the best choice for you. , 
We usually have live music bands ( folk, jazz ) on the evenings and cooking together on open  fire is quite common, too. There are several local  festivals around and we provide up-to-date info about these. , 
If you need some privacy the other day then you can  read or have a nap in a hammock back in the garden. , 
, 
You can rent a bike at your disposal on the spot. The nearby Kali basin is a true paradise for bike lovers with its beautiful surroundings and rare fauna. The lake is ideal for sailing and swimming, too. There are 2 local beaches to choose from, both are a few minutes walk from the hostel. You can also go horse riding in the neighbouring village of Kovagoors., 
All at exceedingly modest prices!, 
A place for all ages and interests highly recommended. The hostel is 2 and a half hour away from Budapest by train. It is easily accesable also from Balaton Airport ( 40 km away).

+++++++++warning about the taxi drivers+++++++++++, 
There is a high level of corruption between the taxis inside the bus station and some hostales! So please do not believe the taxi drivers when they try to persuade you not to come to arequipay backpackers properties taking you to other property, they always lie because those hostales pay the taxis commission and for sure you will not find a better property like arequipay, our comments are our best guarantee!,

Here are a few of our ideas to enhance your San Diego experience:, 
â¢	Spend a day at the beach â we can tell you where to catch the best wave, or sunset., 
â¢	Get international and take the trolley to Mexico â itâs only a short trolley ride away!, 
â¢	Go on a brewery tour and taste why San Diego is Beer City USA.,

There is tons of space to lounge around in and to make friends from all over the world before you hit the town.  If youâre looking to relax after a long day of sightseeing (or after a great night out in the Gaslamp Quarter), you can chill out in our TV room, enjoy our game room which is fully equipped with a pool table and video games or share a meal in our fully equipped kitchen.  , 
, 
Our hostel offers shared co-ed and single sex dorm accommodations of varying sizes to fit your budget.  If youâre looking for a little more privacy or comfort, we also offer private rooms complete with your own bathroom and air conditioner.

Things to do while in Penang;, 
Penang lies just off the north western coast of Peninsular Malaysia. It was Britain's 1st settlement (Est.1786) in the region & for a short time was Malaya's capital before Singapore stole its thunder. Georgetown, the capital of Penang State, combines the best of past and present, East & West, as displayed by its diverse architecture & culture. Laid-back Georgetown is best seen as a walking tour : take your time and meander thru its back streets and discover some of its hidden treasures : Kuan Yin Temple, Kapitan Keling Mosque, Khoo Kongsi Clan House and much more. Pick up the 'Heritage Walking Map' and discover its beauty . Some of the 'must see' in George Town are : , 
, 
* Penang Museum : The best presented museum in Malaysia. Excellent, well-labeled exhibits showcase Penang's history and historical figures, diverse cultures and more. Open from 9am to 5pm. Closed on Friday. Admission fee RM1.00 , 
, 
* Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion (Maison Bleu) : Cheong Fatt Tze (1840-1917), once dubbed as 'China's Rockefeller' by The New York Times, built a vast commercial empire in South East Asia, 1st in Indonesia, then in Singapore. He came to Penang in 1890 and continued his success, giving some of his spoils to build schools throughout the region. His mansion, where he lived with his eight wives was built between 1896 and 1904. Inside are lavish adornments : stained glass, crown moldings, gilded wood-carved doors, ceramic ornaments & seven staircases. , 
, 
*Sri Mariamman Temple : A typical South Indian temple with its elaborately sculptured & painted superstructure (called 'Gopura' in hindu) represents Mt Meru - the cosmic mountain that supports the heavens-that rises above its shrine. Built in 1883 , this is Georgetown's oldest Hindu temple & testimony to the strong Indian influence you'll find in this predominantly Chinese town. , 
, 
*Fort Cornwallis : Today , the battlement studded with old cannons are the only reminder of the fort that was built on the spot where Captain Francis Light first stepped ashore in 1786. Seri Rambai, the largest & most important cannon here is famed for its provocative powers - childless women are advised to place flowers in the barrel and offer it special prayers. ,

                    Hullam Hostel was built nearly 100 years ago and it stands in the heart of the town of Revfulop. Revfulop is situated on the north shore of the lake on the boundary of the Balaton-Highland National Park and the Kali Basin. You can see the whole lake from the nearby tower. The town is famous for its excellent wine, its sports events (e.g. swimming across Lake Balaton) beaches and ancient trees. , 
, 
This hostel is a great base in and out from Budapest or the Adriatic Sea. If you are curious to discover this unique region of Hungary and to meet locals or to taste the local specialities (in music, food, customs) then this hostel is probably the best choice for you. , 
We usually have live music bands ( folk, jazz ) on the evenings and cooking together on open  fire is quite common, too. There are several local  festivals around and we provide up-to-date info about these. , 
If you need some privacy the other day then you can  read or have a nap in a hammock back in the garden. , 
, 
You can rent a bike at your disposal on the spot. The nearby Kali basin is a true paradise for bike lovers with its beautiful surroundings and rare fauna. The lake is ideal for sailing and swimming, too. There are 2 local beaches to choose from, both are a few minutes walk from the hostel. You can also go horse riding in the neighbouring village of Kovagoors., 
All at exceedingly modest prices!, 
A place for all ages and interests highly recommended. The hostel is 2 and a half hour away from Budapest by train. It is easily accesable also from Balaton Airport ( 40 km away).

                    Hullam Hostel was built nearly 100 years ago and it stands in the heart of the town of Revfulop. Revfulop is situated on the north shore of the lake on the boundary of the Balaton-Highland National Park and the Kali Basin. You can see the whole lake from the nearby tower. The town is famous for its excellent wine, its sports events (e.g. swimming across Lake Balaton) beaches and ancient trees. , 
, 
This hostel is a great base in and out from Budapest or the Adriatic Sea. If you are curious to discover this unique region of Hungary and to meet locals or to taste the local specialities (in music, food, customs) then this hostel is probably the best choice for you. , 
We usually have live music bands ( folk, jazz ) on the evenings and cooking together on open  fire is quite common, too. There are several local  festivals around and we provide up-to-date info about these. , 
If you need some privacy the other day then you can  read or have a nap in a hammock back in the garden. , 
, 
You can rent a bike at your disposal on the spot. The nearby Kali basin is a true paradise for bike lovers with its beautiful surroundings and rare fauna. The lake is ideal for sailing and swimming, too. There are 2 local beaches to choose from, both are a few minutes walk from the hostel. You can also go horse riding in the neighbouring village of Kovagoors., 
All at exceedingly modest prices!, 
A place for all ages and interests highly recommended. The hostel is 2 and a half hour away from Budapest by train. It is easily accesable also from Balaton Airport ( 40 km away).

                    Hullam Hostel was built nearly 100 years ago and it stands in the heart of the town of Revfulop. Revfulop is situated on the north shore of the lake on the boundary of the Balaton-Highland National Park and the Kali Basin. You can see the whole lake from the nearby tower. The town is famous for its excellent wine, its sports events (e.g. swimming across Lake Balaton) beaches and ancient trees. , 
, 
This hostel is a great base in and out from Budapest or the Adriatic Sea. If you are curious to discover this unique region of Hungary and to meet locals or to taste the local specialities (in music, food, customs) then this hostel is probably the best choice for you. , 
We usually have live music bands ( folk, jazz ) on the evenings and cooking together on open  fire is quite common, too. There are several local  festivals around and we provide up-to-date info about these. , 
If you need some privacy the other day then you can  read or have a nap in a hammock back in the garden. , 
, 
You can rent a bike at your disposal on the spot. The nearby Kali basin is a true paradise for bike lovers with its beautiful surroundings and rare fauna. The lake is ideal for sailing and swimming, too. There are 2 local beaches to choose from, both are a few minutes walk from the hostel. You can also go horse riding in the neighbouring village of Kovagoors., 
All at exceedingly modest prices!, 
A place for all ages and interests highly recommended. The hostel is 2 and a half hour away from Budapest by train. It is easily accesable also from Balaton Airport ( 40 km away).

+++++++++warning about the taxi drivers+++++++++++, 
There is a high level of corruption between the taxis inside the bus station and some hostales! So please do not believe the taxi drivers when they try to persuade you not to come to arequipay backpackers properties taking you to other property, they always lie because those hostales pay the taxis commission and for sure you will not find a better property like arequipay, our comments are our best guarantee!,

â¢	Get international and take the trolley to Mexico â itâs only a short trolley ride away!,

There is tons of space to lounge around in and to make friends from all over the world before you hit the town.  If youâre looking to relax after a long day of sightseeing (or after a great night out in the Gaslamp Quarter), you can chill out in our TV room, enjoy our game room which is fully equipped with a pool table and video games or share a meal in our fully equipped kitchen.  , 
, 
Our hostel offers shared co-ed and single sex dorm accommodations of varying sizes to fit your budget.  If youâre looking for a little more privacy or comfort, we also offer private rooms complete with your own bathroom and air conditioner.

                    Hullam Hostel was built nearly 100 years ago and it stands in the heart of the town of Revfulop. Revfulop is situated on the north shore of the lake on the boundary of the Balaton-Highland National Park and the Kali Basin. You can see the whole lake from the nearby tower. The town is famous for its excellent wine, its sports events (e.g. swimming across Lake Balaton) beaches and ancient trees. , 
, 
This hostel is a great base in and out from Budapest or the Adriatic Sea. If you are curious to discover this unique region of Hungary and to meet locals or to taste the local specialities (in music, food, customs) then this hostel is probably the best choice for you. , 
We usually have live music bands ( folk, jazz ) on the evenings and cooking together on open  fire is quite common, too. There are several local  festivals around and we provide up-to-date info about these. , 
If you need some privacy the other day then you can  read or have a nap in a hammock back in the garden. , 
, 
You can rent a bike at your disposal on the spot. The nearby Kali basin is a true paradise for bike lovers with its beautiful surroundings and rare fauna. The lake is ideal for sailing and swimming, too. There are 2 local beaches to choose from, both are a few minutes walk from the hostel. You can also go horse riding in the neighbouring village of Kovagoors., 
All at exceedingly modest prices!, 
A place for all ages and interests highly recommended. The hostel is 2 and a half hour away from Budapest by train. It is easily accesable also from Balaton Airport ( 40 km away).

                    Hullam Hostel was built nearly 100 years ago and it stands in the heart of the town of Revfulop. Revfulop is situated on the north shore of the lake on the boundary of the Balaton-Highland National Park and the Kali Basin. You can see the whole lake from the nearby tower. The town is famous for its excellent wine, its sports events (e.g. swimming across Lake Balaton) beaches and ancient trees. , 
, 
This hostel is a great base in and out from Budapest or the Adriatic Sea. If you are curious to discover this unique region of Hungary and to meet locals or to taste the local specialities (in music, food, customs) then this hostel is probably the best choice for you. , 
We usually have live music bands ( folk, jazz ) on the evenings and cooking together on open  fire is quite common, too. There are several local  festivals around and we provide up-to-date info about these. , 
If you need some privacy the other day then you can  read or have a nap in a hammock back in the garden. , 
, 
You can rent a bike at your disposal on the spot. The nearby Kali basin is a true paradise for bike lovers with its beautiful surroundings and rare fauna. The lake is ideal for sailing and swimming, too. There are 2 local beaches to choose from, both are a few minutes walk from the hostel. You can also go horse riding in the neighbouring village of Kovagoors., 
All at exceedingly modest prices!, 
A place for all ages and interests highly recommended. The hostel is 2 and a half hour away from Budapest by train. It is easily accesable also from Balaton Airport ( 40 km away).

+++++++++warning about the taxi drivers+++++++++++, 
There is a high level of corruption between the taxis inside the bus station and some hostales! So please do not believe the taxi drivers when they try to persuade you not to come to arequipay backpackers properties taking you to other property, they always lie because those hostales pay the taxis commission and for sure you will not find a better property like arequipay, our comments are our best guarantee!,

                    San Diegoâs classiest hostel, in the premier Gaslamp neighborhood offers everything a backpacker or business traveler could want. Our recently renovated urban hostel offers shared and private rooms, free Wi-Fi, complimentary breakfast, comfortable spaces to meet new friends, and a worldly staff ready to provide you with the best hostelling experience.,

Check out our weekly events including free dinners, downtown and Balboa Park walking tours, pub-crawls, seasonal trips to the beach and more!  , 
, 
Here are a few of our ideas to enhance your San Diego experience:, 
â¢	Spend a day at the beach â we can tell you where to catch the best wave, or sunset., 
â¢	Get international and take the trolley to Mexico â itâs only a short trolley ride away!, 
â¢	Go on a brewery tour and taste why San Diego is Beer City USA.,

, 
There is tons of space to lounge around in and to make friends from all over the world before you hit the town.  If youâre looking to relax after a long day of sightseeing (or after a great night out in the Gaslamp Quarter), you can chill out in our TV room, enjoy our game room which is fully equipped with a pool table and video games or share a meal in our fully equipped kitchen.  , 
, 
Our hostel offers shared co-ed and single sex dorm accommodations of varying sizes to fit your budget.  If youâre looking for a little more privacy or comfort, we also offer private rooms complete with your own bathroom and air conditioner.

All of our rooms have Tempur-Pedic mattresses, secure lockers and enough plugs to satisfy the techiest traveler. ,

                    Hullam Hostel was built nearly 100 years ago and it stands in the heart of the town of Revfulop. Revfulop is situated on the north shore of the lake on the boundary of the Balaton-Highland National Park and the Kali Basin. You can see the whole lake from the nearby tower. The town is famous for its excellent wine, its sports events (e.g. swimming across Lake Balaton) beaches and ancient trees. , 
, 
This hostel is a great base in and out from Budapest or the Adriatic Sea. If you are curious to discover this unique region of Hungary and to meet locals or to taste the local specialities (in music, food, customs) then this hostel is probably the best choice for you. , 
We usually have live music bands ( folk, jazz ) on the evenings and cooking together on open  fire is quite common, too. There are several local  festivals around and we provide up-to-date info about these. , 
If you need some privacy the other day then you can  read or have a nap in a hammock back in the garden. , 
, 
You can rent a bike at your disposal on the spot. The nearby Kali basin is a true paradise for bike lovers with its beautiful surroundings and rare fauna. The lake is ideal for sailing and swimming, too. There are 2 local beaches to choose from, both are a few minutes walk from the hostel. You can also go horse riding in the neighbouring village of Kovagoors., 
All at exceedingly modest prices!, 
A place for all ages and interests highly recommended. The hostel is 2 and a half hour away from Budapest by train. It is easily accesable also from Balaton Airport ( 40 km away).

                    Experience a different way of staying in Lisbon at our recently-renovated hostel, the closest one to Lisbon Castle., 
, 
Experience the real Lisbon in the most characteristic district of Old Town, where Fado started and where random people sing in winding streets., 
, 
In Lisbon, within the four walls of our hostel, youll find a place with a global flavour, yet it still smells just like home. Could you ask for anything more?, 
, 
Located in the most characteristic of Lisbons neighbourhoods, among winding streets and small cobbled squares, is Alfama Patio: a traditional house, where the living room and kitchen extend onto a grassy garden patio, with greenery climbing the walls and flowers spilling out over their pots. A few steps up, a deck terrace overlooks red-roofed buildings and the Tagus River, lying beneath Lisbon's trademark golden sunlight., 
, 
Our patio is the heart of the house which, undoubtedly, contributed to the hostel s international  Best Atmosphere  award. This is where it all, 
happens: a delicious pancake breakfast every morning in our patio, chill in our hammock, or delight yourself with our amazing terrace view. It s in this setting, at once upbeat and laid-back, that nationalities intermingle and friendships are made., 
, 
But to discover the city, you must venture out beyond the front gate. Our regular group outings lead you to some of the best of what Lisbon has to offer - free-walking tours every morning; Street Art tours; Sintra tours - a UNESCO World Heritage Site; tapas night dinner with a soul-music concert on Wednesdays; Fridays we have our outstanding BBQ with Dj Adan and free sangria; Sundays you can have a night out like the Portuguese style, with a Portuguese buffet followed by a show of live Portuguese Fado music; and bar-hopping into the night in the Bairro Alto neighbourhood on Fridays and Saturdays., 
, 
Through we have activities every night, were not a party Hostel, and after 0.00h you can always continue the party in the local pubs nearby. :), 
, 
Some of Lisbons most popular monuments are barely past the Hostels doorstep, while others are just a ride away on one of the citys yellow electricos (riding in one of these trams is a must-do for any visitor anyway). And because theres a lot worth a seeing outside Lisbon proper, groups of five or more can hop in the hostels own van and be shuttled to nearby Cascais and Sintra or to one of several magnificent beaches close by., 
, 
If after all this youre still undecided, then it may help to know that Alfama Patio has won successive Best Staff awards. When you arrive and are welcomed with open arms, youll understand why., 
, 
The hostel reserves the right of admission for children under 10 years of age.

                    Experience a different way of staying in Lisbon at our recently-renovated hostel, the closest one to Lisbon Castle., 
, 
Experience the real Lisbon in the most characteristic district of Old Town, where Fado started and where random people sing in winding streets., 
, 
In Lisbon, within the four walls of our hostel, youll find a place with a global flavour, yet it still smells just like home. Could you ask for anything more?, 
, 
Located in the most characteristic of Lisbons neighbourhoods, among winding streets and small cobbled squares, is Alfama Patio: a traditional house, where the living room and kitchen extend onto a grassy garden patio, with greenery climbing the walls and flowers spilling out over their pots. A few steps up, a deck terrace overlooks red-roofed buildings and the Tagus River, lying beneath Lisbon's trademark golden sunlight., 
, 
Our patio is the heart of the house which, undoubtedly, contributed to the hostel s international  Best Atmosphere  award. This is where it all, 
happens: a delicious pancake breakfast every morning in our patio, chill in our hammock, or delight yourself with our amazing terrace view. It s in this setting, at once upbeat and laid-back, that nationalities intermingle and friendships are made., 
, 
But to discover the city, you must venture out beyond the front gate. Our regular group outings lead you to some of the best of what Lisbon has to offer - free-walking tours every morning; Street Art tours; Sintra tours - a UNESCO World Heritage Site; tapas night dinner with a soul-music concert on Wednesdays; Fridays we have our outstanding BBQ with Dj Adan and free sangria; Sundays you can have a night out like the Portuguese style, with a Portuguese buffet followed by a show of live Portuguese Fado music; and bar-hopping into the night in the Bairro Alto neighbourhood on Fridays and Saturdays., 
, 
Through we have activities every night, were not a party Hostel, and after 0.00h you can always continue the party in the local pubs nearby. :), 
, 
Some of Lisbons most popular monuments are barely past the Hostels doorstep, while others are just a ride away on one of the citys yellow electricos (riding in one of these trams is a must-do for any visitor anyway). And because theres a lot worth a seeing outside Lisbon proper, groups of five or more can hop in the hostels own van and be shuttled to nearby Cascais and Sintra or to one of several magnificent beaches close by., 
, 
If after all this youre still undecided, then it may help to know that Alfama Patio has won successive Best Staff awards. When you arrive and are welcomed with open arms, youll understand why., 
, 
The hostel reserves the right of admission for children under 10 years of age.

                    Experience a different way of staying in Lisbon at our recently-renovated hostel, the closest one to Lisbon Castle., 
, 
Experience the real Lisbon in the most characteristic district of Old Town, where Fado started and where random people sing in winding streets., 
, 
In Lisbon, within the four walls of our hostel, youll find a place with a global flavour, yet it still smells just like home. Could you ask for anything more?, 
, 
Located in the most characteristic of Lisbons neighbourhoods, among winding streets and small cobbled squares, is Alfama Patio: a traditional house, where the living room and kitchen extend onto a grassy garden patio, with greenery climbing the walls and flowers spilling out over their pots. A few steps up, a deck terrace overlooks red-roofed buildings and the Tagus River, lying beneath Lisbon's trademark golden sunlight., 
, 
Our patio is the heart of the house which, undoubtedly, contributed to the hostel s international  Best Atmosphere  award. This is where it all, 
happens: a delicious pancake breakfast every morning in our patio, chill in our hammock, or delight yourself with our amazing terrace view. It s in this setting, at once upbeat and laid-back, that nationalities intermingle and friendships are made., 
, 
But to discover the city, you must venture out beyond the front gate. Our regular group outings lead you to some of the best of what Lisbon has to offer - free-walking tours every morning; Street Art tours; Sintra tours - a UNESCO World Heritage Site; tapas night dinner with a soul-music concert on Wednesdays; Fridays we have our outstanding BBQ with Dj Adan and free sangria; Sundays you can have a night out like the Portuguese style, with a Portuguese buffet followed by a show of live Portuguese Fado music; and bar-hopping into the night in the Bairro Alto neighbourhood on Fridays and Saturdays., 
, 
Through we have activities every night, were not a party Hostel, and after 0.00h you can always continue the party in the local pubs nearby. :), 
, 
Some of Lisbons most popular monuments are barely past the Hostels doorstep, while others are just a ride away on one of the citys yellow electricos (riding in one of these trams is a must-do for any visitor anyway). And because theres a lot worth a seeing outside Lisbon proper, groups of five or more can hop in the hostels own van and be shuttled to nearby Cascais and Sintra or to one of several magnificent beaches close by., 
, 
If after all this youre still undecided, then it may help to know that Alfama Patio has won successive Best Staff awards. When you arrive and are welcomed with open arms, youll understand why., 
, 
The hostel reserves the right of admission for children under 10 years of age.

                    Experience a different way of staying in Lisbon at our recently-renovated hostel, the closest one to Lisbon Castle., 
, 
Experience the real Lisbon in the most characteristic district of Old Town, where Fado started and where random people sing in winding streets., 
, 
In Lisbon, within the four walls of our hostel, youll find a place with a global flavour, yet it still smells just like home. Could you ask for anything more?, 
, 
Located in the most characteristic of Lisbons neighbourhoods, among winding streets and small cobbled squares, is Alfama Patio: a traditional house, where the living room and kitchen extend onto a grassy garden patio, with greenery climbing the walls and flowers spilling out over their pots. A few steps up, a deck terrace overlooks red-roofed buildings and the Tagus River, lying beneath Lisbon's trademark golden sunlight., 
, 
Our patio is the heart of the house which, undoubtedly, contributed to the hostel s international  Best Atmosphere  award. This is where it all, 
happens: a delicious pancake breakfast every morning in our patio, chill in our hammock, or delight yourself with our amazing terrace view. It s in this setting, at once upbeat and laid-back, that nationalities intermingle and friendships are made., 
, 
But to discover the city, you must venture out beyond the front gate. Our regular group outings lead you to some of the best of what Lisbon has to offer - free-walking tours every morning; Street Art tours; Sintra tours - a UNESCO World Heritage Site; tapas night dinner with a soul-music concert on Wednesdays; Fridays we have our outstanding BBQ with Dj Adan and free sangria; Sundays you can have a night out like the Portuguese style, with a Portuguese buffet followed by a show of live Portuguese Fado music; and bar-hopping into the night in the Bairro Alto neighbourhood on Fridays and Saturdays., 
, 
Through we have activities every night, were not a party Hostel, and after 0.00h you can always continue the party in the local pubs nearby. :), 
, 
Some of Lisbons most popular monuments are barely past the Hostels doorstep, while others are just a ride away on one of the citys yellow electricos (riding in one of these trams is a must-do for any visitor anyway). And because theres a lot worth a seeing outside Lisbon proper, groups of five or more can hop in the hostels own van and be shuttled to nearby Cascais and Sintra or to one of several magnificent beaches close by., 
, 
If after all this youre still undecided, then it may help to know that Alfama Patio has won successive Best Staff awards. When you arrive and are welcomed with open arms, youll understand why., 
, 
The hostel reserves the right of admission for children under 10 years of age.

                    Experience a different way of staying in Lisbon at our recently-renovated hostel, the closest one to Lisbon Castle., 
, 
Experience the real Lisbon in the most characteristic district of Old Town, where Fado started and where random people sing in winding streets., 
, 
In Lisbon, within the four walls of our hostel, youll find a place with a global flavour, yet it still smells just like home. Could you ask for anything more?, 
, 
Located in the most characteristic of Lisbons neighbourhoods, among winding streets and small cobbled squares, is Alfama Patio: a traditional house, where the living room and kitchen extend onto a grassy garden patio, with greenery climbing the walls and flowers spilling out over their pots. A few steps up, a deck terrace overlooks red-roofed buildings and the Tagus River, lying beneath Lisbon's trademark golden sunlight., 
, 
Our patio is the heart of the house which, undoubtedly, contributed to the hostel s international  Best Atmosphere  award. This is where it all, 
happens: a delicious pancake breakfast every morning in our patio, chill in our hammock, or delight yourself with our amazing terrace view. It s in this setting, at once upbeat and laid-back, that nationalities intermingle and friendships are made., 
, 
But to discover the city, you must venture out beyond the front gate. Our regular group outings lead you to some of the best of what Lisbon has to offer - free-walking tours every morning; Street Art tours; Sintra tours - a UNESCO World Heritage Site; tapas night dinner with a soul-music concert on Wednesdays; Fridays we have our outstanding BBQ with Dj Adan and free sangria; Sundays you can have a night out like the Portuguese style, with a Portuguese buffet followed by a show of live Portuguese Fado music; and bar-hopping into the night in the Bairro Alto neighbourhood on Fridays and Saturdays., 
, 
Through we have activities every night, were not a party Hostel, and after 0.00h you can always continue the party in the local pubs nearby. :), 
, 
Some of Lisbons most popular monuments are barely past the Hostels doorstep, while others are just a ride away on one of the citys yellow electricos (riding in one of these trams is a must-do for any visitor anyway). And because theres a lot worth a seeing outside Lisbon proper, groups of five or more can hop in the hostels own van and be shuttled to nearby Cascais and Sintra or to one of several magnificent beaches close by., 
, 
If after all this youre still undecided, then it may help to know that Alfama Patio has won successive Best Staff awards. When you arrive and are welcomed with open arms, youll understand why., 
, 
The hostel reserves the right of admission for children under 10 years of age.

                    The Hostel is located less than 100 metres from the bus stop., 
We have a large terrace, which provides a truly world class view. , 
The bar is popular with guests, very keenly priced for Positano, and we regularly organize trips to Positano's exclusive night club (Music on the Rocks) and to Praiano's Africana., 
For those who love to walk, the hills around Positano provide for great hiking and breathtaking views - ask about our trips., 
High-tech electronic door locks, lockers, and CCTV cameras installed in the Hostel building.   ,

SPECIAL EVENT CONDITIONS READ PLEASE:, 
Reservations for the period July 1st to Aug 31st are of the form 'prepaid and non-refundable'.  This means that they have different payment terms, are subject to a different cancellation policy, and may not be modified.  You will be charged in full for the reservation shortly after you book.  Failure to make payment will mean the booking is cancelled.  Once payment has been made, it will not be refundable should you cancel., 
, 
, 
You may also find the following information useful: , 
If you do intend to drive, street parking is a possibility.  If you park in an illegal parking space, or in a space that endangers drivers (i.e. on a corner), you risk receiving a parking fine.  If you visit during the peak season, it can be difficult to get a parking space., 
There are a minimum of 742 steps to and from the main beach.  This means that most people will find the walk back to be quite exercising.  If you do not want to walk, there are options.  For most, the best option is to catch the bus, which runs every 15 minutes in the main part of the season, and every 30mins during the low part.  A round trip is priced at 1,50 euro if you pay before boarding, or 1,80 euros, if you pay on the bus., 
The Salone - our value dorm option - is located near to the terrace and is popular amongst guests who enjoy our night-time activities; if you go to bed early and are a light sleeper, we recommend choosing another option - for example, other dorm options include regular, premium, and female only dorms., 
We maintain a 72 hours cancellation policy., 
Please do not bring your own alcohol into the hostel, as this contravenes our licensing regulations.

                    Castle Rock Hostel is fabulously located right beside Edinburgh Castle! Our palatial hostel offers wonderful character, with a mix of grandeur and a backpacker vibe! , 
, 
OVER 18's ONLY - NO CHILDREN ALLOWED, 
, 
Enjoy being in Edinburgh's best location & being at the very heart of the city. We are just a stroll from the bus, train and the airport bus and a 1 minute walk from Edinburgh Castle, 1 minute from the Royal Mile & 1 minute from the Grassmarket. We are in a relatively quiet street but the city's wonderful, late night-life is also just around the corner â ideal!, 
, 
Built in 1846 and turned into a backpackers hostel in 1997, we have packed this grand old building full of art, character and antiquity. Some people say it is more an art gallery or museum than a hostel. We think you will love it with our bright, sunny and spacious rooms and great facilities like FREE Wi-Fi, a movie room, a delightful patio and a fire place for those cold winter nights as well as plenty of room to kick back and relax or join in the fun with other travellers., 
, 
Our receptionists will always give you a friendly welcome and can help with any questions about what to see in Edinburgh or about travel around Scotland. We aim to look after you totally so you can have the best holiday possible. Here's a list of more that we offerâ¦,

We also try our best to re-cycle everything (with your help) and our electricity is all sourced from renewable, non-nuclear supplies. Stay with us for a great holiday and minimal environmental impact!,

Grandio is one of the only true party places on this earth that welcomes alcoholics, lost souls and party people with talent but no direction and audiences. Itâs a living, breathing creature that is constantly evolving â the place with a crazy cult following. As well as all that we are in a great location (especially if you like drinking) as we are in the heart of the bar district and everywhere is within walking distance. The only rules we have are about respecting our guests and neighbours and the city noise curfew, other than that we want you to have a wild time and meet amazing people with the same ideas about how to party., 
, 
Every night the Grandio crew will take you out for some of the best nights of your trip. These range from backpackersâ costume parties, Pub Crawls, Party Boats, Spa Parties to our own Budapest Party Hostels Open Mic Night and more, which take you to our favorite (plus some of the cheapest) bars in the city. If you feel like doing something a little different, never fear, as our staff have their finger on the pulse of the city's nightlife and are able to recommend differently nightly activities depending on your tastes. , 
, 
The staff have all been hand picked to party with the guests and show them the best Grandio and Budapest has to offer. They can also offer some great advice of things to do in the city and can give you a full rundown of what to see and do when you arrive. It doesnât matter whether you want to see the sights or just need to know where the nearest 24hr bar is!, 
, 
The place itself is over 150 years old, is heritage listed by the city and has been decorated by street artists from around the world. So the imaginative amongst you might appreciate the fact that all of our rooms and the facade, are decorated by the best street artists of Budapest, and have been added to by global artists who liked what they saw and wanted to make it even better., 
, 
Our hostel has a mix of basic dorm rooms some with en suite and some with shared bathrooms (if you're lucky, a loo with a view), electronic key entry system and with varying numbers of beds. Donât worry though you wonât be sleeping much. , 
, 
During the day, hang out in our courtyard enjoying BBQ's, drinking next to the fire pit, playing some flip pong or drinking strawpedoes with the staff... these are all ways in which we fuel our thirsty and party-hardy guests. If youâre not too hungover during the day, we can organise daytime activities for you such as a range of tours as well as fun activities such as adventure caving, escape houses, paintballing, beer biking, shooting and many more., 
, 
If you are lucky enough to come to Grandio in the winter you will not only find the party atmosphere still going strong but as the jungle bar closes we take over the entire garden courtyard for our own purposes. Open bonfires sitting in the snow and cooking meals whilst downing beers or mulled wine is one of our favourite ways to pre-game before a big night out. The inside common room space increases inside to make plenty of room for drinking games and late night parties., 
, 
Please note: , 
- Grandio is part of the Budapest Party Hostels brand and is one of the wildest of the five. Like the name says, this IS a party hostel, we go out every night, some people drink in the daytime, sometimes sex, and a lot of fun. If you don't like these things, please try a calmer hostel, like our sister hostel Carpe Noctem Vitae., 
- Regrettably, due to previous experience, we can no longer accept bookings for people over 36. If you have booked and are outside this age, please contact us and we will help find you alternative accommodation., 
- Grandio welcomes group booking (including University/Erasmus trips, stag and hen dos, sports tours)., 
-Grandio is not wheelchair accessible
