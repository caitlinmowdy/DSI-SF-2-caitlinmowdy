We all made a reservation to make sure we have a safe room that we want. That's why we book a room before we get somewhere. If you don't have some kind of rooms that costomers want, why don't you delete it on your website??????????????????????? 
why did you let us choose a room as if there were that kinda a room.

347,"Of all the hostels I have stayed at, this was by far my least favorite.  If you are looking to have a fun trip to Vienna and go out at night, this is definitely not the right place to stay.  The last U4 is at 12:15, and it is so far out of the city that there would be no other way back. You will definitely spend a lot of time traveling from the hostel to the city.  

Also, the entire place is overrun with young teenagers.  I felt like I was back in high school again.  There isn't as much interaction as with a backpacker's hostel here, especially if you're over 15.  A junior high class wanted to book an entire floor for their stay, so we had to change rooms our last night there.  They gave us a mixed room without telling us, so we came back that night to find 30 year old men asleep in the same room, and the hostel staff had nothing more to say than ""whoops, sorry.""  

The breakfast is included, but it is jogurt and bread, and every moring I was there, it was all gone by the time I got through the line.  There are lockers in the rooms, and a luggage room to store bags in the day, but be sure to bring your own padlock or you will have to buy one from them for 5 euro.

398,"The most unpleasant hostel I've ever stayed in. 
1) When called from London regarding my booking heard 'What do you want?'. 2)When called the hostel at 22h on the night of arrival to Nice to ask the way to the hostel, found out the owner/manager gave up our beds to somebody else because we came later than  predicted 17h. He did'n want to tell us the way to the hostel and hung up on us.
3) We found the hostel anyway and thanks to other guests who let us in were able to read office opening hours. Not open 24h a day! At 17h they are closed, so if we had come at this time as expected, the hostel would have eeen closed anyway... Read that opens at 7h.
4) Slept outside in  the car (it was fortunate we had it). Returned at 7am. Buzzed the door (hotel on 2nd floor) and rang from my mobile - no answer. Continued calling appx. every 30 min up to around 9am - nobody picked up. Got in thanks to other guests. When got upstairs, the owner didnt want to let my friend in, as from this day only I had reservation for further 3 nights. As he was extremely rude, we started to quarrel - he said 'It's my hostel and I can do what I want'. Also to my muslim friend - 'Just because you have a scarf, do you think you can do what you want?!, and to me (I'm Polish) - 'How should I talk to you- in English or in Polish??!! - indicating I didnt understand. He didnt even want my friend to use the toilet (finally let her). What's unacceptable, he was physically violent - grabbed her and shook by her shoulder!! He said he didnt care we had to sleep outside in an unknown city.
5) When I returned at 12.30 I had to pay for my stay before even I was shown my room. I asked for receipt, he said OK, but never gave it to me. 
6) I booked 5 people room, but had 6 people room.
7) I didnt receive the keys to the building and the flat, only to the room, which meant I was totally at mercy of the owner to let me in. He said he didnt have enough keys. When I was leaving, I had to make sure with him if he is gonna let me in at certain hour! On one occassion I had to rang from my mobile as he didnt answer the buzz from downstairs.  I had the opportunity to get the keys for the last night, only after I asked. Anyway, I didnt take the keys cos couldnt give him my passeport or 30 euros in deposit.

The only thing is that when we arrived there were a group of people that were trying to check-out that had a bad incident.  They found an open condom in their room when they came back from visiting Venice.  There was no one on the front desk (until noon at check-in) and they were having problems locating the owner to make the complain.  They end up calling the police and reporting the incident.

The thing is that there was this 'guy' that had checked-them-in when they arrived that was now saying that he didn't worked there... so buy 1 pm we were still waiting for check-ing.  After the police arrive and filled the paperwork, the group left and magically the same 'guy' now an employee checked-us in.  Very weird.  I was already calling my travel insurance to get a different hostel.

Most of the time there is no-one at the front desk.  They give you a key for your room and a key to the front door.  At check-out you leave the key in the front desk.  Not too much security, and if you arrive early as us (11 AM) you will have to wait around until the 'employee' appears.

Character: 
- Elevator rarely on service. It rarely come when you call, you have to run for it if it's nearby. We stayed on 5th floor and walking up at the end of the day after been on sight-seeing the whole day is tiresome.
- Internet access. No WLAN and there are only 3 PC stations which do not work most of the time of our stay. Luckily we brought our own laptop and connect the cable to our laptop instead.
- Drinks in the reception area is ridiculously expensive. 4 euro for a small bottle of beer. Maybe it's their way of forcing you to go out to supermarket.
+ Good think about this hostel is that there are enough bathrooms/toilets available and also plenty of locker space.

Security: so-so with normal bring-your-own-locks and trust-your-neighbour

Location: Although not document anywhere, you can come to the hostel with blue-line Metro station Castro-Pretorio as well, in case you're coming from Tiburtina station. There are shops and bars nearby so it's quite convenient

Staff: There was one girl who was quite helpful but the rest are not so keen on servicing people. Service-mind are not their big selling point. Also it took a guy who checked us in 3 minutes just to type our names (just 2 names) and I mentioned the problem with PC stations already, so their skills are out of question. Good thing is that they're quite an eye-candy though.

The double rooms in the pool house can be very noisy as they are next to the outside area where the parties happen. Our stay was in Summer and it may be different at other times. ,3523061,8.7,Hostel Lao,"Mendoza, Argentina",http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Hostel-Lao/Mendoza/16017

698,"This place has an excellent location in Old Town Dubrovnik.  Dubrovnik is a little touristy, but worth it--spectacular.  The room was fine (I stayed in a double room by myself).

However. . .with apologies for the rant. . .I took a 2 month trip, and this place had the worst service.  I coordinated my arrival time, etc. by email with one of the owners.  When I showed up to check in, the ""hostess"" wasn't there as promised.  Turned out the owner hadn't communicated with his wife and the hostess (who was going to let me in)--they had therefore been expecting me at a different (arbitrarily chosen, I guess) time.  I wasted a couple of hours    getting to a phone and working through this, but was ultimately able to get in and the wife was very apologetic and nice about it--no harm done.  However, the hostess wasn't so gracious and, more importantly, was a negative for the rest of the stay.  The air conditioner didn't work--her response was just to say that she'd have to talk to the owners on Monday (I was leaving 8am Monday morning).  I couldn't get the hot water to stay other than freezing for more than 4 mins--same (non-) response (and I noted that it was possible that I just didn't know how to work the shower system--she still wouldn't come to take a look at it or anything).  Worse yet, when I paid with local currency (I had a rate quoted in Euros), she gave a worse exchange rate than the money changers in town.  I called her on it, and she just said she had to use the rate fixed by the owner.     I think it was ridiculous (the owners live there and should be able to use the  local currency, so there's no excuse for them charging you for paying with that currency); also I question whether the owners actually want to anger guests about that sort of thing when it ultimately is just a matter of a couple of bucks.  At any rate, my view was that either the owners are a problem and using this hostess as the heavy, or she was the problem and they weren't reigning her in (I didn't see her check in with them at all).  I'd bet the latter. . .either way I'd stay somewhere else next time.",3869099,7.3,Villa Flora,"Dubrovnik, Croatia",http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Villa-Flora/Dubrovnik/14437

754,"A strange hostel to comment on accurately - the rooms are basic and not all beds have mosquito nets. The hostel is in a quiet and beautiful neighbourhood with excellent security (there are embassies all around!) but the flipside is that there is little to do locally, not even good shopping. But we would go there again, mostly because of the owner, Mr. Lee, who is charming and polite. He really cannot do too much for his guests and is a wonderful advertisement for Kenya, Nairobi in particular. On the basis of ""you get what you pay for"" this is an ideal place to use as a base for exploring Nairobi (if you can either afford the taxis or are brave enough to use the minibuses) and anyone needing an affordable, basic room with no frills - it's only a place to sleep after all - could do much worse and could hardly get a warmer welcome than we received. Shame about the beds not being too comfy, though.

Fantastic place to stay, very cheap and great value for money. Room was good, nice privacy with the wrap around curtains in the bunks. Staff very friendly and the place itself is great, there's lots to do. Great breakfast facilities also. Nearest tube is a bit of a hike, but that's a small gripe. If you're looking for a hostel to stay in London, don't even bother looking anywhere else. I stayed previously in St Christopher's Shepherds Bush and the contrast couldn't have been greater. One of the staff there was extremely unhelpful bordering on the rude (he'd just the day before dropped a fridge on his foot, so that I guess gives some indication of not only his level of intelligence, but his state of mind, so maybe he was different normally I don't know), a fellow  Aussie no less, the shame!

The staff is really bad. On the website it's written you have mixed bedrooms, and you don't have, they are separate (even though practically they're not at all). A person who coulnd't come, even though cancelled her reservation more than one day in advance was obliged to pay for all the nights we had deserved. The rules don't make sense and anyway they change everyday. For example: You have a kitchen, but you can't use it exept than for the microwave oven. The manager told living room and kitchen would have closed at 12 30, then the day after he changed his mind and wrote on a paper at 11 30. Often they were just closed because  he was at the bar, so in the end he's even not consequent.
The internet it's just 20 minutes a day, because ""more costs too much"", as if we didn't know that he just pays for a flat monthly rate (which was obvious) and one day was broken.
The bar downstairs it's nice and with live music, but very noisy on the weekend, so, if you plan to sleep before 2 am, forget it.

we noticed, that we want to check-in 11am. When we arrived at half past eleven it wasn't possible to go in our room. We had to wait 45mins!

The hostel offers a service to leave the luggage for a while in a luggage room after check out.
But this service wasn't free. That's pitty. I never had paid for keeping the luggage in a luggage-room in a hotel or hostel before.

The breakfast consits from toast you can toast by yourself, instant coffee, milk, tea (two types), magarine, marmelade and chocolate creame. The performance wasn't really delicious. There are even not enough seats to take breakfast.
This should be the continental breakfast...

1546,"This is a fun place to spend your stay in Rome, though you may be tempted to hang out rather than see the city!  There are always movies playing, and a large collection of them to watch at any time, cheap internet, free food/drinks all day long.
This hostel is pretty well located, very safe/secure and two of the staff (the Philipino and Australian, Roberto) are both very fun.  The night man is either scatter-brained or cruel.  He caused us to almost miss our shuttle bus, and our flight home.
We had been planning to stay up the entire night before we left as we wanted to be up at 3:30, our shuttle bus was at 4:30 am...  At around 12:30-1:00 am the night clerk (Canadian/Scandinavian background) told us to get rest and that he would wake us up at 3:30.  I asked him to physically pull me off the bed if I didn\&#039;t get up at 3:30..  He promised that he would get us up, and I had double and triple checked to make sure he would get us up.  So we went to bed... at some point in the middle of the night I woke up, and checked the time... it was 4:20 am!  I ran out in the hall and asked if my watch was wrong, and he was angry at me asking why we hadn\&#039;t come out for breakfast at 3:30 am, and was mad at me for that!  I told him that he had said he would wake us up but he said nobody ever told him to wake us up, and denied talking to me a few hours prior.  He was arguing with me about it as me and my fiance were trying to grab our bags and leave!   We had to RUN to Termini where our shuttle was already departing!!!  
Aside from that, the hostel is clean to look at, but don\&#039;t walk around barefoot or your feet will turn black!  Also our bathroom was always very smelly!  It was never very noisy in our room so you should be able to sleep just fine.
My only caution is that you absolutely should not trust the overnight man (Canadian/Scandinavian guy) to wake you up, no matter what he says, don\&#039;t take the chance we did.  Otherwise I would completely recommend this hostel on the basis of the OTHER staff, the character, value, and how much fun we had there.

1547,"Beautiful rooms, lovely painted ceilings (its located in an old palazzo).  It really is a 5-10 minute walk from all the major attractions!
There are several caffe\&#039;s and grocery stores nearby which will save you lots of money during your stay.  The hostel provides a large fridge for anybody\&#039;s use.  
It is loud at night, apparently the windows need to be left open so it doesn\&#039;t get too hot, and so lots of noise travels inside, sometimes until 1 AM and then starting again probably at 6 AM.  I managed to sleep through it though just fine, though I know some people had problems, so bring ear plugs if that might be you!
I would recommend bringing drinks with you for the entire day, prices near the attractions are up to 3,50 EUR for 30 cl (355 ml) of soda.  If you buy a 1,5 L at a grocery store it will cost you only 2 EUR.  Water is much cheaper at grocery stores but not at the attractions.

1548,"For 50 EUR this is a great deal!  Especially if you are sharing a dbl room with a friend!  The regular prices are 85 EUR for a single, 135 EUR for a double room.  
When we arrived they claimed they had not received my deposit (as they said I booked w/ an invalid card) and that they therefore did not hold a reservation for me.  My card WAS valid, and I had never been notified that there may have been a problem.  They put us into a single room for the first night, and eventually admitted that yes, they did receive my deposit (so I still do not understand what the problem was if they had already receieved money from me!!)
The next morning we met a couple from Scotland who had also booked for a dbl room, but were told that there was no reservation for them in the system at all.  They were also put into a single room for their first night.  We figure that they must be double booking their rooms, and that the people who book for the cheaper price of 50 EUR are the ones who get moved.  It seems like they try to find excuses of why to move those who book at Hostelworld...
Otherwise the rooms are great, very clean, spacious... 
Free breakfast is great, meat and cheese, breads and cereals, fruit salad, fruit juice, coffee/tea, etc...
The location sucks, to be honest... the hotel is located on the mainland, in Mestre, but couldn\&#039;t be further from any shops, grocery stores, etc..!  It is a 20-30 minute bus ride to the island of Venice.  
Beware that at night you must take a different bus at get off at the hospital, and walk the rest of the way... the hotel staff say the walk is 900m, I think they\&#039; are underestimating the distance!  
If you\&#039;re fit and don\&#039;t mind the walk, or taking the bus in to Venice I would absolutely recommend this hotel.  We found it to be absolutely worth the money!

The whole place was disgusting, especially the bathroom. What I disliked the most was the fact that the walls between rooms only reach up to about 60cm from the ceiling, meaning you get to hear absolutely everything and see the light in the other rooms, which can be very disturbing when people go out and come back at half past five in the morning, which happened every single night we spent there.

2022,"This place has the best location, in my opinion. It's in a square that is around the university and one of the few places in Venice where locals actually live. The place, unlike most of Venice, comes alive at night. There are great bars and great pizza and gelato right outside the door. The room I was in was fine, although the beds are a little bit close together and one morning I had a dormmate standing right over me getting ready to leave. The shower on our floor wasn't working properly, but the staff gave me a key to the second floor bathroom and that solved that problem.

2258,"For a hostel of this size we would have considered there to be much more adequate security. A young man we befriended whilst staying at the hostel had his wallet stolen and we had one of our umbrellas stolen. Admittedly, our loss was not that great, but the staff seemed neither very capable of dealing with these issues adequately or like they really cared about us. The rooms were aweful, the concept of double bunk beds so that guys and girls who are strangers had to sleep in the same double bed brought the concept of ""sardines in a tin"" to a new low. We also wish that you guys were as interested in your guests getting a good nights sleep as you were about your neighbours. We had drunk people coming in at 3am every night making lots of noise and sometimes smoking in the rooms and the girl at the reception was only interested in pointing out that it is a dormitory room. It would have been really nice to have the basic needs in our room, we didn't even have a power point. How are you supposed to charge a mobile etc? The staff suggested I charge it downstairs in a public area near the bar but at the rate things were going missing at this place, no way!

It was too noisy into the early hours of the morning with people coming in and slamming doors right outside my room, and by 07-30am the hotel workers were arriving and making more noise.
I don't think it's right that that room should cost the same as the others yet they didn't suffer the same sort of noise. The room had a shower that didn't work properly and also the waterdidn't drain away that quick. The problem with the show head was fixed as soon as i pointed it out to the manager but the water draining away was never corrected.
I also pointed out to the manager that the power plug on the wall where the lmirror was didn't work but no one ever came to fix it I didn't sleep too well because a couple of nights there was loud music coming from the room above and i'm sue i wasn't the only person to hear it. .

As it was already 10pm and we were tired from a long day this was not something we enjoyed going through.  After that the stay was ok.

On arrival the man on the reception desk had no record of our booking but managed to find us a double room, not twin as requested. When we booked we were asked to choose a check-in time but when we arrived at this time (11am) we were told the room wouldn't be ready until 1pm, which was very annoying and impractical as they refused to hold our luggage. The man was very abrupt and not at all apologetic for this, he was unfriendly for the whole of our stay although the other members of staff were very pleasant. 

Other down points included there being no air-conditioning and even in September it was boiling at night. There was a ceiling fan but it made little difference. We didn't feel very safe or have any privacy with the large windows open as there were no curtains. 

However, it wasn't all bad. Although basic, the room was spacious and there was a good powerful shower with plenty of hot water and complimentary toiletries. We weren't allowed to take our room key out with us but there was always someone around to let us back in to the main building so it was easy to come and go as we pleased.

Even though when we booked we were offered free breakfast and internet, these were taken away and an astonishing 5 euro per hour fee put on internet. We paid 3.50 euro for breakfast, only to have none of the promised items out (no croissants or fruit as told by desk staff). The kitchen is not a usable kitchen, there is ONE electric hotplate for 450 beds, so you have to cook your pasta first, then your sauce, with a growing queue behind you. They do have a lovely dining room and kitchen, unfortunately reserved for their restaurant, so everyone who cooks their own food has to sit on the 2 piddly tables in the kitchen.

The theme nights were pathetic with no one attending, luckily we smuggled our own alcohol in so we didn\'t have to deal with their lousy card system.

When checking in, we had to queue for an hour, and then because they couldnt get us a room for the whole 4 nights (despite booking 3 weeks in advance), we had to come back down the next morning and queue for another hour. The staff are nice, but stressed. They need about triple the staff to run the hostel, for our sake and to keep their current staff sane!

Some of the staff were really friendly and helpful while others treated you as an inconvenience. The breakfast lady is not nearly as nasty as I expected, a simple bonjour goes a long way!

Security was a bit of an issue as only one key is available per room, so the door is often left open, and the left luggage room is not locked.

6375,"The worst hostel i've ever been to. i've been to ones in japan, korea, canada, and other regions in thailand. it's not only the problems with the hostel itself. the roles written on hostel.com were violated and the staff at the counter didn't bother to explain at all. 
so these are the probs. i found annoying.
1. the staff were very unkind and even rude somewhat.
2. we made a reservation for a twin private but they gave us a four-bed-dorm saying they don't have it any more. hello~ we BOOKED it, remember??
3. the doors of the little dingy toilets are extremely unreliable. you can't piss and dump without your own guard.
4. the only spare remote for the a/c was broken. we had to keep it on no matter how cold we got, or no matter how hot we got during the night. and i already had a bad cold. guess what. of course i felt a lot better the next morning??
5. i didn't expect for a towel to lay down nicely on the bed when i walked in since it's a hostel. but it seems like they just don't have anything else to do except ripping the guests off. the usual towels were for sale for FREAKING 6 us dollars. they are like A or two dolloar/s in any other place in thailand. 
6. internet!! if you walk 5 mins from the hostel, there are pc cafes that charge 25B for an hr. guess how badly they want to nick yr pocket. it's FREAKING 2B  per min. it's just ridiculous. 
7. hostels.com tells you there won't be any other cost once you arrive in the accomomdation. and all the costs are charged in the currency you've choosen. i paid the deposit in us$ with my creadit card online and of course was going to do the same with the rest sum when i got there. but he there was 3% service charge for using a creadit card. so i said i'll pay with cash. THEN! the exchange rate they applied was 2.5B more than the rate you see everywhere in thailand.

i can go on a few more details. but the time is running. JUST DON'T GO!! they are not even quailiried to be named ""HOSTEL."" One of the staff there was the most unfriendly hostel staff i've ever come across. he owes me about 30B for the worng math. idiot!

The hostel was pretty mucj as described on the website with a few exceptions.

You had the possiblity to prepare your own breakfast and eat it in the room next to the kitchen but in reality this room was unusable in the morning because the cleaning lady always did her job in that time slot.She didn't allow us to stay there at that moment. So we had to take our breakfast in the room or downstairs in the reception room.
There were also some other small problems inherent to such a place but they can be easily overlooked.

6706,"Wow.  That's really all I can say about this place.  It isn't central, but is very close to the tram stop which is served by a bunch of day lines and one of the handful of night trams (crucial if you're out partying late!).  Local services are great (food, groceries, etc), and you're only a 5 minute walk to the huge outdoor/indoor market.  Good (and cheap) pizza place opened up right next door.

The facilities are absolutely spotless.  Rooms were spacious and have great rolling lockers large enough to stash all of your bags plus another smaller locker to store smaller stuff above the beds (bring your own locks).  Great bathrooms, wooden floors, decent net access, good breakfast buffet and a great bar in the basement with 25Kc beer (about 1 USD as of this writing).   Plus they give you a great map of Prague and a great little guide to the city and neighborhood to boot (although I highly recomend the Lonley Planet or Time Out city guides as a supplement).

Added local secret, if you walk one block north and one block east there is a little beer/wine shop.  If you speak Czech I think you can sample some of his offerings.

6869,"Astor Hyde Park is like the Southwest Airlines of hostels- No Frills. The location can't be beat though! Within 5 minutes walk of 2 Underground stations: Bayswater (District and Circle lines) and Queensway (Central line- I think). The Bayswater area is filled with shopping and restaurants, a mall, a bowling alley, and supermarkets. There is plenty to do. Down the street from the hostel is an art cafe where internet use is only 1 pound for an hour which is much cheaper than at the hostel. There is also a great Lebanese restaurant that has delicious shawarma for a deal. 
The hostel has a comfortable lounge area, decent sized kitchen, SKY TV (like direct TV in the states), video game machines, and its own bar downstairs. The rooms are small and rundown, but there were sinks in our rooms both times we stayed here. There is an international feel here, but it can get very loud in the evenings. Staff are friendly and helpful. 
Bathrooms and showers are small, cramped, and semi-dirty...plan on bringing your own handsoap and sanitizer ...toilet seat covers may not be a bad idea either. Toilets have low water pressure and often didnt flush well. 
In terms of security, there is a communal luggage room that is always over-flowing. We had private rooms and could leave our stuff without worry, but I'm not sure if there are lockers in mixed dorms...

We went off to do a 4 day jungle trek up to Machu Picchu and were able to leave our bags here which was great as we could not take them with us. We came back to the hostel  after 4 days of gruelling trekking and were welcomed back with open arms.  It was like coming back to home and to luxury.  We stayed in some other VERY BASIC hostels  in Santa Maria and Santa Teresa that were a million miles away from this hostel in terms of comfort.

He was not appologetic or care that we wedre put in a room we did not book or want to pay for. In addition, we were quite far from the ""dowtown"" Paris (Latin Quarter,etc.). What the website does not tell you is that the ""hotel"" (not of hotel calibre) is in the sex and drug district of town.

8398,"-when you arrive, there is key one per room. unless, you re in room 13, which is only locked during lock out hours, but is otherwise open to whoever
-in room 13, which is the dormitory room, one wall is absent. instead, there is an aluminum partition, on the otherside of which there is the cleaning crew breakroom and/or closet. the aluminum \""wall\"" doesn\'t fully touch the floor or the ceiling, allowing god-knows-what to come into the room at night.
-speaking of god-knows-what, after leaving the hostel, we discovered numerous bite marks all over our legs from the bedding
-there is nowhere for you to lock up your posessions. there are no lockers are lockable crates. instead, you have the option of leaving your baggage in the baggage room, but the key is left in the door at all times. there is a safety deposit box, but if you\'re a traveler, it is not sufficient for all your belongings. to add to this issue, upon arrival, we were  informed by our fellow dorm-mates that there had been several instances of theft
-as far as the staff goes, Greer is the only who can help. additionally, one member of the staff made inappropriate advances, offering massages, inappropriate grabbing, and stood in the dorm room watching people change.
-there is a 9am-3pm lockout, which is enforced by the cleaning crew coming into your room at 8:45, turning on the lights, banging on the door and screaming at everyone to get up
-the area surrounding the hostel is not your picturesque Parisian neighborhood. instead, you will find people offering to sell you hash, gawking and grabbing girls, and screaming out car windows that they want to \""f*ck your mumps\""
-the main picture displayed on the hostelworld website, is actually a picture of the building next door.

8577,"Upon arriving Seoul, we took the number 602-1 bus and got off at the Anguk station stop. However, as some others may have commented, Beewon was slightly tricky to find but it\&#039;s easy after a few days :) The location is great as it is pretty much across from the Changdeokgung palace in the alley.  For reference point buildings, look for the Wedding Hall building with a large picture of a Korean couple posing in a wedding theme photo and Beewon is the third building behind it or 3 buildings away from the Changdeokgung palace. Also, Anguk station is about 6 mins walk and for people planning to visit Seoul, you will just love the convenience of the Seoul Subway! 
Beewon\&#039;s staff were great at helping us from day one and were very hospitable and respectful. As one example, Beewon was sold out for one out of the 6 nights which we booked for so, I walked next door to this local motel where there were no english speakers to help me. Slightly stressed, I walked back to Beewon and asked them to help me and they called them for me and also wrote a note to give the motel for reserving the room!  
We stayed in the Ondol room with the double bed and it was very clean.  The bed is VERY firm but comfortable. As seen in the pictures, there is a TV with english channels that shows english to hollywood movies every night (with Korean subtitles). They also have AC and washroom is just as you see in the picture. For backpackers, if you forget toothpaste or soap, not to worry because Korean hostels and motels provide you the soap and toothpaste. 
Breakfast is complimentary which consists of a very simple toast with butter or jam, powdered coffee, and Korean tea every morning from 9-11 am. High speed Internet is available free for Beewon guests. Just arrived back on April 24 and can\&#039;t wait to go back and stay at Beewon again!

We booked a room for 3 and they gave us a room for 2 with a little broken bed to install ourself. It was impossible to sleep on it. 

At breakfast we found the food in a box on a dirty floor. We were looking for a place to seat and the staff pushed us saying we had to move. 
When we raised a complaint the staff told us to change hotel if we weren\'t happy.

Regarding this bad experience, we advice to don\'t book this hotel.
